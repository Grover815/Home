## What is This?
This repo is just a bunch of small usually one file projects in languages like c#, python, and html where I like to mess around.

## The Files

* Caculator.cs - A caculator program for terminal.
* DisplayMotorEncoder - a small script for RobotC that Displays Motor Encoder Values.
* ReverseChar - A test to see how you would reverse a string of text. Only works for a set amount of characters so not too good.
* SHA256 password - A trial and error to see how you would do authentication in the terminal.
* Program.robotc - An autonomous program written for the 2019 VexIQ challenge.
* TicTacToe.py - A tic tac toe game using the GUI Zero library.
* LinePercentage.py - A script to see the percentage of three random points being a triangle or line.
